        <p>  I love living in Seattle! My husband and I relocated to Seattle two years ago. I love the outdoors and I used to mountain bike and hike a lot before my surgery last year. I also used to do hair but my body and the doctor told me it wasn't such a good idea anymore. I love movies and reading. You will never find my Kindle far from hand and Saturday night isn't complete without a few explosions from the latest action flick.
        </p>
        <p>I decided to take web design classes because my husband and I built a website for my friend as she was starting her own business. I enjoyed learning how it all came together and doing a lot of the 'design' and graphics as well as watching my husband make Season and mine ideas come to life. I am halfway through the Web Design Certificate program at Seattle Central and loving every minute of it!
        </p>
			  <p>I used to do hair and make-up full time unfortunately my body informed me that I was not allowed to do so any more.  I still keep my hand in from time to time and enjoy doing hair and make for special events.  
			  </p>
			  <p>Last but certainly not least.  FOOD!  I love to eat. I love to bake.  I love to cook. I love food.  Some of my best childhood memories are helping my mom in the kitchen.  To this day it is still where you often find us.  About a year ago I found out I was allergic to wheat so now I spend my time trying to adapt all my childhood favourites into gluten-free options; sometimes successfully sometimes not.
